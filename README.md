SMART TRAFFIC VIOLATION PATTERN DETECTION :

This project aims to automatically detect and record various traffic violations such as helmet violation, mobile phone usage while driving, and triple riding using computer vision. The system analyzes video or image inputs to identify violations and generate pattern reports that help authorities improve road safety and enforcement efficiency.

KEYFEATURES:

--Detects multiple violations in real-time using trained ML models.

--Generates violation reports and stores results in CSV format.

--Identifies recurring violation patterns to support data-driven insights.

--Provides visual bounding boxes and violation labels on images.
